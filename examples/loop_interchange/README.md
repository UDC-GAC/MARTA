# Cost model for loop permutation

**RQ.- How to relate source code metrics (e.g., loop depth, nesting, trip count,
type of array access: affine vs. non-affine, reuse direction/distance, etc.)
with the application of loop interchange in GCC, when using the flag
`-floop-interchange`? In other words, can we reverse-engineer the cost model of
GCC to apply interchange?
