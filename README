ubench or microbench is a framework for reverse-engineering features of the
architecture. Some information regarding a concrete architecture may not be
fully disclosed by the manufacturer. This

For this reason, we designed a tool which is able to extract information by executing mini-kernels with different
configurations in order to determine on which conditions the performance varies.
E.g. if a kernel with the same number of floating point operations (FLOPs) for
two different configurations (e.g. two different strides, same compilation
flags) delivers different performance, the system will be able to discover the
